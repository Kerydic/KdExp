# 流水线问题记录
## 1、BatchMode打包，如果希望使用自定义Symbol进行条件编译
The asynchronous nature of Unity’s compilation mentioned above is also important to understand if you are writing Editor scripts which will run in batch mode in the Unity Editor on a continuous integration (CI) server. This is because when the Editor runs in batch mode, it runs “headless”, so there is no editor loop which would cause it to recompile with the new scripting symbols. Because of this, you should not use Editor scripts to set scripting symbols within a batch mode CI server because the scripts will not be recompiled, so they will not be applied.

Instead, if you need specific symbols to be defined in an Editor running in batch mode, you must ensure the editor is launched with the correct symbols defined from the start. You can do this by specifying the symbols using a csc.rsp asset file instead of using editor scripts, as described below.
以上为UnityManual原文。故目前的猜想：启用BatchMode前，使用脚本修改csc.rsp文件内容，使其包含（且仅包含）我们需要的Symbol，再启用BatchMode。

## 2、HybridCLR项目安装
因为HybridCLR运行Install过程中会拉取两个Git Repo，为了避免版本更新中删除该库导致大幅文件变化/SubModule变化，不把其放入Git版本范围。编写流水线代码时，需要考虑导入项目后，先运行一遍HybridCLR的安装操作
